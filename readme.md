Mo-Sponsive Boiler Plate v0.1 (alpha)
=========================

	This is a Boiler Plate for getting started with Mo-Sponsive (A.K.A., ReSS). Why not call it ReSS, you may ask... It sounds like REST, which is a totally different can of worms. Also, Acronyms are so 2000 and late.
	
	This boiler plate uses Mobile_Detect.php which was developed by serbanghita. I highly recomend keeping an eye on his github. https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect
